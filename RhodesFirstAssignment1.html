                <h2> About Me </h2>
                <p> Hello! I'm Austin, a software engineer and aspiring game developer as well as an Air Force veteran
                    from
                    North
                    Carolina, US. I've always loved video
                    games more than anything and I dreamed of making my own from as early as I can remember playing
                    them.
                    I'm
                    currently building my skills while working on a
                    side scrolling game I am tentatively calling "Block Boy the Monster Slayer". Currently I am
                    pursuing
                    a
                    bachelors
                    in
                    IT at American Military University and plan to transfer to a Computer Science and Game
                    Development
                    program
                    at
                    North Carolina State University.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On this site you can see some of the projects I've been working on. I am emmensly curious,
                    commited
                    and
                    a
                    fast
                    learner. I love learning
                    the technical background to software and the amazing video games I get to play.
                </p>
